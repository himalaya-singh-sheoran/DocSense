Metadata-Driven Python-Based Data Loader Component

Objective:
To optimize our data processing workflow by reducing reliance on SSIS packages, minimizing development effort, and accelerating turnaround times.

Key Benefits:

Decreased Dependence on SSIS: Replaces traditional SSIS packages with a more versatile and powerful Python-based solution.
Simplified Development: Reduces the complexity and time required for developing data loading processes.
Enhanced Efficiency: Significantly improves turnaround times, enabling faster deployment and updates.

Problem Statement: 
Traditional data loading methods utilizing SSIS packages are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and inflexible. Our objective is to introduce a metadata-driven Python-based data loader component to alleviate these challenges by reducing dependency on SSIS, minimizing development efforts, and accelerating turnaround time for data loading processes.
